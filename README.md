# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to create a website using data that is in a Javascript array to be able to easily see UFO sightings. There are several filters we added to the to the website to make it easy for people find UFO sightings they are interested in.  

## Results 
You can filter by date, city, state, country, and shape. But you do not have to fill out all filters. For example you can put in "nc" or a state and it will show you all the sighting in that state. That is a cool feature! This way people can find either a date they are interested in, maybe something weird they saw on that day or if you want to see if there are any sighting in your state you can!

## Summary 
One drawback is that everything has to match perfectly, it is case sensitive, so if you type "Bonita" instead of "bonita" you will not get a result. Which is a tad confuising since you should capitalize city names and abbreviation for states. I would change this and not make it case sensitive. I also would add a table so you can see all the different ways they classify the shape, because one shape is "cigar" so I would have a list of shapes and either a picture or description before the data.
